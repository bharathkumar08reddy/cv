                 at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting
                  side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the 
                  bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side

                   getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out")</td>
